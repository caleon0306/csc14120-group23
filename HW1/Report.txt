Based on running the tests a few times it appears that using no more than 7
for the K value works best. After 7 the accuracy consistently drops. 
The reason I believe the accuracy drops after 7 is because of the randomization 
of test vs sample. With each test getting random samples the results appear to be
decided by what is included in the sample, and not direct neighbors. If there is a
sample with a lot of one flower then a k of 20 will make it easier for
a flower on the edge of two groups to get put into the wrong group. If a flower
belongs to group A and there are not many in the sample there will be less
samples to compare it to, whereas group B has a lot in the current sample. This 
means the prediction will be based on what flower is randomly put into
the sample.

I generally see the highest accuracy around 6-7, but it can vary.
