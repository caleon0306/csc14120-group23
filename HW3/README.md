This repo is for CSCI 4120.

## Quick Start
Download the HW3 file into your virtual enviroment location

You need to activate the virtual environment when you want to use it:
```
source python_venv/bin/activate
```

To fufil all the requirements for the python server, you need to run:
```
pip3 install -r csci4120-nogroup-leonc22-main/HW3/requirements.txt
```
Because we are now inside a virtual environment. We do not need sudo.

Then you can start the server with:
```
jupyter-notebook
```
